I've been given a project idea and I'm required to put a strategy to transform it into a running code by 

making software requirements and functionalities,
Flowchart and
UML Diagram of classes, functions, and attributes


description of the project is:
In this task, a courses centre wants to build an online platform for its students. The owner
wants to use this platform for new students to register for his online courses and for his
current students to be able to access existing videos. He also wants to use it to show each
course schedule, lessons, tutor, number of students registered, and duration. Through this
platform he wants to follow up his students' progress and attendance, so he needs you to
create some sort of a dashboard for each student that could be accessed by both the owner
and the student himself.
For simplicity:
- Let no course be dependent on the other, so any student can register for any course he
wants.
- A student can register for only one course at a time.
- There are no limited seats for each course, so a single course can be attended by any
number of students.
- A course would be taught by only one tutor and no assistants are needed to help monitor
the teaching process.
